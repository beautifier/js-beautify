# JS Beautifier

...or, more specifically, all of the code powering
[jsbeautifier.org](http://jsbeautifier.org/).

This little beautifier will reformat and reindent bookmarklets, ugly
JavaScript, unpack scripts packed by Dean Edwardâ€™s popular packer,
as well as deobfuscate scripts processed by
[javascriptobfuscator.com](http://javascriptobfuscator.com/).

To beautify from the command-line you can use provided `jsbeautifer.py`
script/library. Run it to see its usage information; e.g
`./jsbeautifier.py file.js` beautifies a file, output goes to `stdout`.

To use `jsbeautifier.py` as a library is simple:

``` python
import jsbeautifier
res = jsbeautifier.beautify('your javascript string')
res = jsbeautifier.beautify_file('some_file.js')
```

...or, to specify some options:

``` python
opts = jsbeautifier.default_options()
opts.indent_size = 2
res = jsbeautifier.beautify('some javascript', opts)
```

Note that only the HTML+JS version supports unpacking various packers.

You are free to use this in any way you want, in case you find this
useful or working for you.
