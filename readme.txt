 JS Beautifier
---------------

  ...or, more specifically, all of the code powering jsbeautifier.org.

  This little beautifier will reformat and reindent bookmarklets, ugly
  javascript, unpack scripts packed by the popular Dean Edward's packer,
  as well as deobfuscate scripts processed by javascriptobfuscator.com.

  You are free to use this in any way you want, in case you find this
  useful or working for you.

  To beautify from the command-line you can use provided beautify-cl.js
  script, using Rhino javascript engine. See the file contents for the
  details.

  Alternatively, you can use the V8-based or QtScript-based command-line
  versions, see the v8/ and qtscript/ subdirectories for the details.
