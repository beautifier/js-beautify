# Changelog

## v1.7.3

### Description
* Fixed broken installs

Lessons learned:
* Don't publish and go to bed.
* I thought I had sufficient test coverage and I did not. Tests will be implemented to protect against this before the next release (#1254).
* Also, this break highlights the need to create a beta channel for releases and a way to request feedback on beta releases (#1255).
* The project has been maintained by mostly one person over the past year or so, with some additions by other individuals. This break also highlights the need for this project to have a few more people who have the ability address issues/emergencies (#1256).
* Many projects do not not lock or even limit their version dependencies.  Those that do often use `^x.x.x` instead of `~x.x.x`.  Consider switching to making major version updates under more circumstances to limit risk to dependent projects.  (#1257)
