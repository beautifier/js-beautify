## v1.13.0

### Description
This release truly fixes the python cssbeautifier installation and updates cssbeautifier cli to use the same general code as jsbeautifier. 

Also, as of this release Node.js 8.x is no longer guaranteed to work. Node.js 8.x LTS reached end-of-life in January 2020. 
Parts of our test infrastructure no longer support Node.js 8.x. The js-beautifier should still run on Node.js 8.x, but it is not part of the CI system and so not guaranteed to work. 


### Closed Issues
* (internal) Refactor python cssbeautifier to reuse jsbeautifier CLI methods ([#1832](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify/pull/1832))
* (internal) Switch from node-static to serve ([#1831](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify/pull/1831))

## v1.7.3

### Description
* Fixed broken installs

Lessons learned:
* Don't publish and go to bed.
* I thought I had sufficient test coverage and I did not. Tests will be implemented to protect against this before the next release (#1254).
* Also, this break highlights the need to create a beta channel for releases and a way to request feedback on beta releases (#1255).
* The project has been maintained by mostly one person over the past year or so, with some additions by other individuals. This break also highlights the need for this project to have a few more people who have the ability address issues/emergencies (#1256).
* Many projects do not not lock or even limit their version dependencies.  Those that do often use `^x.x.x` instead of `~x.x.x`.  Consider switching to making major version updates under more circumstances to limit risk to dependent projects.  (#1257)
